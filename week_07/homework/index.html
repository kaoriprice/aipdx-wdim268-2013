    <!-- I made an editable To-Do List.
It uses the contenteditable attribute and local storage to achieve this. As soon as the To-Do List is changed, the content will be stored to the local storage. This means that when you close your session, the data still stays there and be displayed when you open the same page again. However, since it is saved in local storage, it has to be opened from the same computer that you have edited it in.
